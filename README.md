# ee101-as3-rock_scissor_rock_game
Since I had used some C11 standard code, it is possible that some old version compiler cannot compile my code.
However I have fully test my code on gcc and it ran well.

Strongly recommand to use gcc compiler!!

You can install it through run the compilergcc.bat 
or download from https://obs-410c.obs.myhwclouds.com/setup/tdm64-gcc-5.1.0-2.exe


After installation, you can use command "gcc -O2 -s 1717608_3.c -o game\game" to compile.

If you are not familar with gcc command, please run compilergcc.bat, it will compile my code automatically!
